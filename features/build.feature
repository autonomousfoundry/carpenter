Feature: Build

  Scenario: A requirement and corresponding plan
    Given a requirement
    And a verification that checks for a temp file
    And a plan that creates the temp file
    When I invoke the build
    Then I should see that the build succeeded
    And the temp file should exist

  Scenario: Verification is run again after building
    Given a requirement
    And a verification that fails
    And a plan that creates the temp file
    When I invoke the build
    Then I should see that the verification failed

  Scenario: Specify an alternate requirements file
    Given a requirement in an alternate file
    When I invoke the build with an alternate file
    Then I should see that the verification was missing

  Scenario: Specify an alternate definitions directory
    Given a requirement
    And a verification in an alternate folder that fails
    When I invoke the build with an alternate directory
    Then I should see that the plan was missing
